# ISR vs SSG: Next.js Data Fetching Strategies for 2025

Next.js offers powerful data fetching methods. In 2025, choosing between SSG and ISR impacts both freshness and speed.

## Static Site Generation (SSG)

- Builds pages at compile time.
- Ideal for truly static content and portfolio pages.
- Pros: Fast builds, perfect cache hits.

## Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

- Revalidates pages at runtime based on TTL.
- Balances freshness with static performance.
- Pros: Always up-to-date, minimal rebuild overhead.

## Choosing the Right Strategy

| Strategy | Use Case                            |
|----------|-------------------------------------|
| SSG      | Documentation, blogs with infrequent updates |
| ISR      | News feeds, dynamic dashboards      |
