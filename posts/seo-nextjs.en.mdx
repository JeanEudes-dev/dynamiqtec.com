# Best SEO Practices for Next.js Static Sites in 2025

In 2025, SEO remains a critical factor for visibility. Next.js static sites benefit greatly from server-rendered metadata and performant builds.

## Key Strategies

- **Semantic HTML**: Use proper heading hierarchy and HTML5 elements.
- **Meta Tags**: Optimize `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, and Open Graph tags.
- **Structured Data**: Implement JSON-LD for articles and breadcrumbs.
- **Performance Metrics**: Focus on LCP, TTFB, and Cumulative Layout Shift.
- **Hreflang & Canonicals**: Support multilingual routes and avoid duplicate content.
- **Image Optimization**: Add descriptive `alt` text and use next/image for responsive sizes.
